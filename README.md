## Overview
This repository contains the main machine learning techniques applied in the field of data science, 
with a brief theory and some projects using each of the techniques covered. In addition, this repository 
is constantly updated, adding new techniques and new projects solved.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree and Randon Forest
* Suport Vector Machine (SVM)
* Principal Componente Analisys (PCA)
* K-Means-Clustering
* Artificial Neural Network

## Software used
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/about/) programming language was used to prepare the scripts. In addition, data analysis, 
data visualization and machine learning libraries were used, which are:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## How to use
The use of this repository can be approached in two ways: (1) you can execute (and modify) the Jupyter Notebook files, to understand 
the techniques and replicate the projects carried out; (2) **to be built...**

#### Method (1):
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jralbbuquerque/ds-machine-learning.git`
* Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Open your `jupyter-notebook` (or `jupyter-lab`) and run the files contained in the `notebooks` folder
* The notebooks use the databases contained in the `datasets` folder

#### Method (2):
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jralbbuquerque/ds-machine-learning.git`
* Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **To be built...**
